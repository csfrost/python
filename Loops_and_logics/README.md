# 🐍 Python Logic and Loops

Understanding Python's logic and loops is key to developing efficient and powerful programming solutions. This repository covers core Python control flow concepts — from conditional statements to advanced comprehensions — through hands-on exercises and practical examples.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Conditional Statements** — Decision-making with `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- **Development Environment** — Setting up and using VSCode for Python development
- **Loops** — Working with `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks and data handling
- **Loop Control** — Managing loop flow with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- **Comprehensions** — Writing concise list and dictionary comprehensions

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, I developed a solid grasp of Python's conditional statements and loops, and I am ready to tackle more complex programming challenges.
