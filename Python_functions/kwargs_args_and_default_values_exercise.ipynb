    "Create a Python function named `calculate_forest_area` that accepts two arguments: `trees` (the number of trees) and `area_per_tree` (the space each tree occupies, defaulting to 10 square metres). The function should compute the total forested area based on these inputs. It should also include an optional `deforestation_factor` parameter, which defaults to **0.2** and represents the proportion of forest lost to deforestation. The function should return the **remaining forest area** after subtracting the deforested portion."
